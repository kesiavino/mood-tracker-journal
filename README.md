This repository currently hosts the most basic MVP of the Mood Tracker Journal, a web application designed to help users track and visualize their emotional well-being. The current iteration features a Flask backend for API handling and SQLite for data persistence, along with a JavaScript frontend (styled with Tailwind CSS) for intuitive journal entry. Users can record sentiment-tagged entries and view mood trends through interactive Chart.js visualizations. I am actively working on enhancing the frontend user experience and expanding the backend capabilities to include advanced features like user authentication and deeper sentiment analysis.
